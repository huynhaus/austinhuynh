        Once again, I've restarted my personal website project because I didn't like how the last one looks. It seems like this project
        of mine runs through the same lifecycle. First, I start it back up again because I'm interested in learning a new technology
        (this time was AWS). After a few weeks, I either get bored or eventually come to hate what I wrote and drop the project. Well
        this time will be different! Eh... probably not, but I do like how it's looking and it's already been 2 full days!

        As mentioned before, I decided to try out AWS since cloud development is so popular. Honestly, I wanted to see how easy (or hard)
        it would be to host the full stack of a web application. I don't plan to do much more outside of that.

    <p>Anyways, let me catch you up on the last 2 days.</p>

        Day 1. I spent a few hours looking around at different websites for inspiration on my own layout. I used 5 different sites and came up
        with what you see now. I'm a big fan of minimalistic design and sometimes that leads me to a stale or bland look. Some of the ideas I picked
        up from the different sites include: using an accent color, styling my favorite quotes, and shrinking the width of the main content. My
        goal is to keep this as simple as possible. I'm going to do my best to not pull in a CSS framework.

        Day 2. I was shocked that it only took me the morning to figure out how to host this Angular application on AWS and hook it up with my
        domain name. This was much more painful when I tried it with Heroku and Digital Ocean although my problems came from my lack of
        knowledge. Shout out to youtube videos and blog posts! I spent the rest of the day cleaning up code, and writing more content.

    <p>Last but not least, I can't forget to make a checklist of all things I want to do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Figure out how to deploy code automatically from Bitbucket</li>
        <li>Add photo albums</li>
        <li>Create and host a media server with my old desktop</li>
        <li>Create an api to pull photos and videos into an album from the media server</li>
        <li>Make my website awesome by automatically pulling albums in</li>
        <li>Anime tracking app?</li>
        <li>Hook into Spotify to display my top songs and podcasts</li>
        <li>Track my tennis results by pulling data from UTR or USTA</li>
        <li>Randomize my favorite quotes and create an admin page for me to upload to</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <p>I also strung one of my tennis racquets. Something that also takes me too much time, but is worth it in the long</p>

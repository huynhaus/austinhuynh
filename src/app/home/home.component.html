I've been developing code for an insurance company for 8+ years. I've had plenty of opportunities to learn different technologies, but I'm currently working as a full stack developer using Angular, Springboot, SQL Server, and Openshift. I typically write web applications and integrations for internal or external use. I focus on writing readable, maintainable, and simple code when possible. I'm passionate about learning more and improving my own skills. Although I have more experience using Spring and Java, I'm currently interested in learning more about UI design and general Angular development. Other fields I'd like to learn more about are cloud applications, security and efficiency.

My family immigrated from Vietnam so that makes me a second generation American. I'm very spoiled with all of the good food they cook and the vacations we go on. For fun, I love playing tennis. I've played tennis for 20+ years and you can find me playing various UTR (9.0) or USTA (4.5) leagues and tournaments.
